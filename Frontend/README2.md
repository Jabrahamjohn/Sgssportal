## ‚úÖ Summary for Frontend Collaborator

1. Understand the **roles and workflows** (Member, Committee, Admin).
2. Base the frontend on REST endpoints from Django.
3. Build dashboards and forms according to user journeys.
4. Use session cookies for auth.
5. Keep all actions transactional and user-role scoped.
6. Work in feature branches and test against backend seed data.

This ensures the SGSS portal runs smoothly, respecting both the technical and governance logic of the Medical Fund.
