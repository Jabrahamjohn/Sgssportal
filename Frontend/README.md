# üß≠ SGSS MEDICAL FUND SYSTEM ‚Äî WORKFLOW & FRONTEND BUILD OVERVIEW

## üèóÔ∏è System Summary

The **SGSS Medical Fund Portal** digitizes all operations of the Siri Guru Singh Sabha Medical Fund.
It handles **member management**, **medical claims**, **chronic illness requests**, **claim reviews**, and **fund governance** as per the Constitution (2015) and Bylaws (2024).

The backend (Django REST Framework) exposes structured APIs for the frontend (React/Vite) to interact with.

## üß© Core Functional Modules (System Flow)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Membership Management**

**Purpose:** Register and maintain fund members and their coverage types.

**Data Flow:**

* Admin adds or updates **Membership Types** (e.g., Single, Family, Senior).
* Admin creates or approves **Member** profiles ‚Üí assigns membership type, NHIF number, and validity period.
* Backend ensures **60-day waiting period** before a member becomes eligible for claims.

**Frontend Tasks:**

* Member registration form (Admin view)
* Member dashboard showing membership status, expiry, and limits

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Claims Processing**

**Purpose:** Members request medical reimbursement according to fund rules.

**Workflow:**

1. **Member creates claim** ‚Üí selects type (`Inpatient`, `Outpatient`, `Chronic`).
2. Adds **claim items** (consultation, drugs, procedures, etc.).
3. Uploads **attachments** (receipts, NHIF slips, doctor report).
4. Submits ‚Üí claim status = `submitted`.
5. **Committee reviews:**

   * May set status to `reviewed`, `approved`, `rejected`, or `paid`.
   * May enter discretionary override if necessary (‚â§ Ksh 150,000).
6. Claim undergoes **auto-computation**:

   * Fund share = 80%
   * Member share = 20%
   * NHIF/other insurance amounts deducted
   * Ceilings and annual limits enforced
7. **Member gets notifications** of each update.

**Frontend Tasks:**

* Claim submission form (multi-step)
* Claim detail view with itemized charges
* Upload section for documents
* Real-time status updates (via notifications)
* Review dashboard (Committee view)

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Chronic Illness Requests**

**Purpose:** For members with recurring medical conditions requiring monthly drug support.

**Workflow:**

1. Member submits chronic medication list (JSON-style: name, strength, dosage, duration).
2. Request reviewed by committee.
3. Committee updates status: `pending` ‚Üí `approved` or `rejected`.
4. Member receives notification and can view approved medicines.

**Frontend Tasks:**

* Chronic request form
* Chronic medicine tracker (status timeline)
* Admin/Committee chronic list management

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Reimbursement & Settings**

**Purpose:** Define global financial limits, rules, and ceilings.

**Managed By:** Admins & Committee.

**Data Flow:**

* `Settings` model holds key configurations:

  * Annual benefit limits (Ksh 250,000)
  * Critical illness top-up (Ksh 200,000)
  * Fund share percentage (80%)
* `Reimbursement Scales` define category-based limits.

**Frontend Tasks:**

* Admin dashboard: configurable fields for ceilings & fund shares
* Committee view: adjustable reimbursement scales table

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Notifications & Audit Trail**

**Purpose:** Track every system action and notify relevant users.

**Events Trigger Notifications:**

* Claim submission, approval, or rejection
* Chronic request updates
* Admin changes or overrides

**Frontend Tasks:**

* Notification panel for all roles
* ‚ÄúMark as read‚Äù interaction
* Audit log page (Admin only)

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Attachments (File Uploads)**

**Purpose:** Store supporting claim documents.

**Data Flow:**

* Stored in `/media/claim_attachments/`
* Linked to claim via `ClaimAttachment` model
* Downloadable via API

**Frontend Tasks:**

* File upload component (drag & drop)

---

## üîê 7Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication & Access Flow

**Auth Framework:** Django session-based authentication (cookie stored).

**Frontend Behavior:**

* On login, session cookie stored in browser
* Axios/Fetch automatically sends cookie on every request
* Backend identifies user role via Django Groups

**Frontend Routing Example:**

| Role      | Default Route          | Redirects  |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Member    | `/dashboard/member`    | `/claims`  |
| Committee | `/dashboard/committee` | `/reviews` |
| Admin     | `/dashboard/admin`     | `/members` |

## ‚úÖ Final Recap

The **Frontend Developer‚Äôs primary goals** are:

1. Implement **role-based dashboards**.
2. Build **data-driven components** consuming REST APIs.
3. Enable **file uploads**, **form validation**, and **notifications**.
4. Maintain **clean modular structure** ‚Äî you‚Äôll define your own boilerplate.
5. Ensure the **system‚Äôs workflow mirrors real SGSS operations** as above.
